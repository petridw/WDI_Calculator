# Mathing Is Awesome Javascript Everything Super Review Lab

## Requirements

Using everything they've learned so far about Javascript variables, objects, functions, loops, events, and the rest, **build yourself a handy and useful calculator.** It could be any kind of calculator – something to help you calculate square footage, something to help you convert cooking measurements, something to help you write box-shadows with CSS. Write separate functions that calculate each thing you need to, and wrap it all up in an object to start practicing using objects practically.

**The idea is to get practice building front-facing, interactive Javascript applications with vanilla Javascript.** Make it pretty, and make it fun.

###### - - Important Workflow Note - -
Before starting, make it a git repository, and set it up to be able to push to Github. As you work on it, make _frequent_ and regular commits, and make sure your commit messages are telling of what changes you've made as you do them. Remember – git is to help you keep track of your history, and the more history you have, the better.

At the end of the class, Hipchat out a links to your project – no matter how finished it is – so we can all see how everyone made their calculators together.
